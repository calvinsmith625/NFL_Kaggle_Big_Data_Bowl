# Tracking_Data

prelim_implement: creates an interactive visualiztion in bokeh and creates a naive gradient boosetd machine. Currently a project in the works from the NFL's Big Data Bowl.

targetprob: handles the data wrangling (in R) of 17 weeks of tracking data. Computes key features, including the angle of a receiver from the Quarterback given by arctan(m). Hyperparamter tuning and in-depth modeling is still in progress for the models.
